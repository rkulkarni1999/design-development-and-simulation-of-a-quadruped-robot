# Design, development and Simulation of a Quadruped Robot. 

The necessity of mobile robots for complex and dangerous environments has initiated the development of dynamic quadruped machines, which exploit the potential advantages of the legged locomotion and enhanced mobility in unstructured terrains. Such a versatile system with high manoeuvrability should be labour efficient, cost-effective, and indispensable in industries. The Quadruped Robot presented is a low cost, robust and stable walking machine which finds its applications in a wide array of fields such as Disaster Management, Exploration, Inspection, Medical and Military Applications. The Design process begins by determining mechanical parameters and mathematical models of a 3 Degree of Freedom articulated leg and then repeating the same articulated leg 3 times over to mimic a 4-legged animal. Then, the physical structure of the planned model is modelled in a 3D CAD Software (Fusion 360), which is then structurally and dynamically analysed for validation using Ansys. Initially, the simulation of the project was conducted in Bullet Physics Engine, but currently the robot is under development to Integrate with the Robot Operating System (ROS) and use the CHAMP development framework for configuring the quadruped and using control algorithms based on the "Hierarchical controller for highly dynamic locomotion utilizing pattern modulation and impedance control : implementation on the MIT Cheetah robot".
